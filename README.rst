cordex python package


Description
===========

There is not much implemented yet, but this repository is meant to be a start for collaboration.


Installation
============

You can install the package directly from github using pip:

.. code-block::

    pip install https://github.com/euro-cordex/cordex
    
If you want to contribute, I recommend cloning the repository and installing the package in development mode, e.g.
    
.. code-block::

    git clone https://github.com/euro-cordex/cordex
    cd cordex
    pip install -e .
    
This will install the package but you can still edit it and you don't need the package in your `PYTHONPATH`

Requirements
============

* python3.6 or higher
* numpy
* pandas
* parse


Note
